another nice neo example:

http://neo4j.com/developer/example-project/

  Example Project Description

  To demonstrate connection to and usage of Neo4j in different
  programming languages we’ve created an example application. It is a
  simple, one-page webapp, that uses Neo4j’s movie demo database
  (movie, actor, director) as dataset. The same front-end web page
  consumes 3 REST-endpoints provided by backend implemented in the
  different programming languages and drivers.

    - movie search
    - single movie listing
    - graph visualization of the domain



  Domain Model

    (:Movie {title,released,tagline})<-[:ACTED_IN {roles}]-(actor:Person)

MATCH (movie:Movie {title:{title}})
 OPTIONAL MATCH (movie)<-[r]-(person:Person)
 RETURN movie.title as title,
       collect({name:person.name,
                job:head(split(lower(type(r)),'_')),
                role:r.roles}) as cast LIMIT 1


{query:"(?i).*matrix.*"}

MATCH (movie:Movie)
 WHERE movie.title =~ {query}
 RETURN movie

MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a:Person)
 RETURN m.title as movie, collect(a.name) as cast
 LIMIT {limit}

bob.properties["age"]   = 44

alice.push()
bob.push()

# Here, we add a new property to each of the two local nodes and push
# the changes in turn. This results in two separate HTTP calls being
# made to the server which can be seen more clearly with the debugging
# function, watch:

from py2neo import watch
watch("httpstream")

alice.push()
  > POST http://localhost:7474/db/data/batch [146]
  < 200 OK [119]

  > POST http://localhost:7474/db/data/batch [146]
  < 200 OK [119]

#
# bundle updates
#
graph.push(alice, bob)


# Pulling updates from server to client is similar: either call the
# pull method on an individual entity or batch together several
# updates by using Graph.pull.


graph.cypher.execute("CREATE (c:Person {name:{N}}) RETURN c", {"N": "Carol"})


for record in graph.cypher.execute("CREATE (d:Person {name:'Dave'}) RETURN d"):
    print(record)


# A Record exposes its values through both named attributes and
# numeric indexes. Therefore, if a Cypher query returns a column
# called name, that column can be accessed through the record
# attribute called name:

for record in graph.cypher.execute("MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name AS name"):
    print(record.name)



# Transactions

# To use this endpoint, firstly call the begin method on the
# Graph.cypher resource to create a transaction, then use the methods
# listed below on the new CypherTransaction object:
#
#    append(statement, [parameters]) - add a statement to the queue of statements to be executed (this does not pass any statements to the server)
#    process()                       - push all queued statements to the server for execution and return the results from those statements
#    commit()                        - push all queued statements to the server for execution and commit the transaction (returns the results from all queued statements)
#    rollback()                      - roll the transaction back

# For example:

tx        = graph.cypher.begin()
statement = "MATCH (a {name:{A}}), (b {name:{B}}) CREATE (a)-[:KNOWS]->(b)"

for person_a, person_b in [("Alice", "Bob"), ("Bob", "Dave"), ("Alice", "Carol")]:
    tx.append(statement, {"A": person_a, "B": person_b})

tx.commit()


# Unique Nodes
#
# Many applications require some form of uniqueness to be maintained
# for the data they manage. Neo4j’s optional schema feature allows
# such uniqueness constraints to be applied to a graph based on a
# combination of label and property and py2neo exposes this capability
# through the create_uniqueness_constraint method of the Graph.schema
# attribute:

graph.schema.create_uniqueness_constraint("Person", "email")

# If an attempt is made to create two nodes with similar unique
# property values, an exception will be raised and no new node will be
# created. To ‘get or create’ a node with a particular label and
# property, the merge_one method can be used instead:

xavier = graph.merge_one("Person", "email", "charles@x.men")

# This method is idempotent and uses a Cypher MERGE clause to only
# create a node if one does not already exist. If no uniqueness
# constraint has been created for a particular label and property
# combination however, it is possible for a MERGE to return multiple
# nodes. For this case, py2neo provides the related merge method.



# Unique Paths
#
# When it comes to building unique relationships, the
# Graph.create_unique method is a handy wrapper for the Cypher CREATE
# UNIQUE clause. This method can accept one or more Path objects,
# including Relationship objects (which are simply a subclass of
# Path).
#
# Let’s assume we want to pick up two nodes based on their email
# address properties and ensure they are connected by a KNOWS
# relationship:

alice = graph.merge_one("Person", "email", "alice@example.com")
bob   = graph.merge_one("Person", "email", "bob@email.net")

graph.create_unique(Relationship(alice, "KNOWS", bob))

# We could of course extend this to create a unique chain of
# relationships:

carol = graph.merge_one("Person", "email", "carol@foo.us")
dave  = graph.merge_one("Person", "email", "dave@dave.co.uk")

graph.create_unique(Path(alice, "KNOWS", bob, "KNOWS", carol, "KNOWS", dave))

# Here, only relationships that do not already exist will be created
# although the whole path will be returned.

that's not exactly d3 format - 

Which can be converted to our visualization format by collecting the
nodes and relationships of the different rows into two lists. Just
make sure that each node is unique in the list and that the
relationships refer to the array-index (not the id) of the node.

function idIndex(a,id) {
  for (var i=0;i<a.length;i++) {
    if (a[i].id == id) return i;}
  return null;
}
var nodes=[], links=[];
res.results[0].data.forEach(function (row) {
   row.graph.nodes.forEach(function (n) {
     if (idIndex(nodes,n.id) == null)

does:

  MATCH (js:Person)-[:KNOWS]-()-[:KNOWS]-(surfer)
  WHERE js.name = "Johan" AND surfer.hobby = "surfing"
  RETURN DISTINCT surfer

    ()        empty parenthesis to ignore these nodes
    DISTINCT  because more than one path will match the pattern
    surfer    will contain Allison, a friend of a friend who surfs

Many applications require some form of uniqueness to be maintained for the data they manage. Neo4j’s optional schema feature allows such uniqueness constraints to be applied to a graph based on a combination of label and property and py2neo exposes this capability through the create_uniqueness_constraint method of the Graph.schema attribute:

>>> graph.schema.create_uniqueness_constraint("Person", "email")

If an attempt is made to create two nodes with similar unique property values, an exception will be raised and no new node will be created. To ‘get or create’ a node with a particular label and property, the merge_one method can be used instead:

>>> xavier = graph.merge_one("Person", "email", "charles@x.men")

This method is idempotent and uses a Cypher MERGE clause to only create a node if one does not already exist. If no uniqueness constraint has been created for a particular label and property combination however, it is possible for a MERGE to return multiple nodes. For this case, py2neo provides the related merge method.

- discover - simple experiment to diff the public members from last time, when there is a new batch
  - i think that any update implies that all of them are new


googe is one that frequently has an enormous "new" public member result

  src/github/organization/google/tracker.meta.json

    has an empty public_members list

  ah.  so the trick is that i'm not updating/saving meta?


refactored a lot, and added tracing.

where are the etags stashed?

  XXX currently ~/etags.json

----

continuting to regularly get giant bursts of public_members, which seems wrong

  maybe the members are all stored as one entity, with one etag, so whenever
  one person is added, the whole thing is considered updated?

    in which case, *we* need to track/diff


----



[20150310]

i think etag may not work perfectly?

"tracker discover" reported all projects for someone that i've been
tracking for a couple of days, and about 100 public members.  unlikely
that they are new.

could be me not storing previous meta correctly, but i don't think that's it

maybe it's me failing to handle an error, and storing a bad etag?

spark moved, from "bdas/spark" to "apache/spark" (and repo was replaced)

would be great to have a couple of things:

  - symlinks
  - the org-using-github-hierarchy working
    - 
  - remove


experiment:

(re-)check out spark in to src/github/organization/apache

cd src/cloud/spark

# we don't have a full "rm" yet

install github3.py, with goal of tracking companies/developers (i
frequently want to see what else someone is working on, once i like
one of their projects)


sudo pip install github3.py

note: pulls in a nice-looking library called "requests":

Requests: HTTP for Humans

Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely
verbose and cumbersome. Python's builtin urllib2 module provides most
of the HTTP capabilities you should need, but the api is thoroughly
broken. It requires an enormous amount of work (even method overrides)
to perform the simplest of tasks.

Things shouldn't be this way. Not in Python.

>>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com', auth=('user', 'pass'))
>>> r.status_code
204
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'application/json'
>>> r.text
...


Requests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers,
form data, multipart files, and parameters with simple Python
dictionaries, and access the response data in the same way. It's
powered by httplib and urllib3, but it does all the hard work and
crazy hacks for you.

Features

    International Domains and URLs
    Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling
    Sessions with Cookie Persistence
    Browser-style SSL Verification
    Basic/Digest Authentication
    Elegant Key/Value Cookies
    Automatic Decompression
    Unicode Response Bodies
    Multipart File Uploads
    Connection Timeouts
    Thread-safety
    HTTP(S) proxy support


and anothe package:

uritemplate

Simple python library to deal with URI Templates. The API looks like

from uritemplate import URITemplate, expand

# NOTE: URI params must be strings not integers

gist_uri = 'https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists{/gist_id}'
t        = URITemplate(gist_uri)

print(t.expand(gist_id='123456'))

# => https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists/123456

# or
print(expand(gist_uri, gist_id='123456'))

# also
t.expand({'gist_id': '123456'})
print(expand(gist_uri, {'gist_id': '123456'}))


Where it might be useful to have a class

import requests

class GitHubUser(object):
    url = URITemplate('https://api.github.com/user{/login}')
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.api_url = url.expand(login=name)
        response = requests.get(self.api_url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            self.__dict__.update(response.json())

When the module containing this class is loaded, GitHubUser.url is
evaluated and so the template is created once. It's often hard to
notice in Python, but object creation can consume a great deal of time
and so can the re module which uritemplate relies on. Constructing the
object once should reduce the amount of time your code takes to run.

updating /home/jeff/src/tracking/mining/gensim/gensim
  pull result: 1

You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you
want to merge with, and 'branch.deep-tracing.merge' in
your configuration file does not tell me, either. Please
specify which branch you want to use on the command line and
try again (e.g. 'git pull <repository> <refspec>').
See git-pull(1) for details.

If you often merge with the same branch, you may want to
use something like the following in your configuration file:
    [branch "deep-tracing"]
    remote = <nickname>
    merge = <remote-ref>

    [remote "<nickname>"]
    url = <url>
    fetch = <refspec>

See git-config(1) for details.

  result: /home/jeff/src/tracking/mining/gensim/gensim - 1


this one is probably trickier.  i *have* done a ton of work in a gensim 
checkout, but i thought it was separate


ah, right.  this was an experiment in trying to work on a branch
in the same repo that i'm updating.  i don't think it worked

just start over.  moved git to git-failed-attempted-deep-tracing-branch

added another git pattern: http://git.code.sf.net/p/guitarix/git

updated tests

cd sandbox/oompa

nosetests

  failed.  not sure why, but not about this change

cd tracking/tests

nosetests

  yep, works

----

this checkout (with an alternate name) is throwing the checkout off:

instructions say "git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/guitarix/git guitarix"

tracker co http://git.code.sf.net/p/guitarix/git guitarix

  the project is checked out as "git", not "guitarix"

  write some tests in test_VCSBackend, and fix VCSBackend._determine_project_name

tracker co http://git.code.sf.net/p/guitarix/git guitarix

  figured out guitarix, but checked out in to git/git/guitarix

enough for today.  just check out and track the hard way this time




[20120219]

added another git pattern - git://

trying to find the problem with checkout - always crashes during the
track part, at least with git - a folder exists where we are trying to
make a symlink

----

trying to check out roundup, and i think sourceforge shut me down,
though something was wrong, because i'm trying a checkout multiple
times


cd src/dev/issue-trackers

tracker co git://roundup.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/roundup

fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

  XXX something wrong?  result: 128
      cd /home/jeff/src/dev/issue-trackers/roundup/git; git clone git://roundup.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/roundup 

tried by hand, same thing.

try again in a little while ...




[20120218]

hg output much better



[20120213]

cleaned up hg output a little bit

  - don't care about these:
    comparing with https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy
    searching for changes
    changeset:   52394:286b7a2ad62f
    parent:      52392:f312b056bb07


TODO: make this *optional* - maybe some people do care

-----

tabling this one.  it's nice to remember everything i want to track,
and it's not that much noise (yet)

- option to only report projects that have updates,
  vs reporting all that we are about to try ...
  - just wait to report "updating"
    - might be tricky, i think those messages are separate



[20120212]

stopped reporting the second half of the mercurial output - the part
that talks about "adding changeset", ...  the number of files changed
does not matter in this context.  just more noise


[20120204]

starting over with source.  too much cruft, some of it 10 years old
and no longer really useful

moved sandbox/oompa to sandbox/oompa-old, and only copied 
over enough to get tracker to run.

hg init

# add everything that's in there now
#   XXX how to automatically ignore __pycache__ and .pyc?

# create a .hgignore file

  __pycache__

hg add

hg commit -m "initial checkin"

switching over to list-based pattern detection, using tests

based on a python testing taxonomy page, it seems like nose might be
the best path

  - test discovery
  - extra support

easy_install nose


cd oompa

nosetests

cd oompa/tracking/tests

nosetests

  appears to gobble stdout?

tracker co https://bitbucket.org/genericcontainer/goblin-camp

  XXX vcs_utils could not detect 

added hack to dictate that bitbucket is hg.  XXX which is not always
correct - bitbucket supports both

  - may need to provide a clue, or try twice

hg checkout works:

cd src/games

tracker checkout http://openblox.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/openblox/openblox 





[20120118]

fixed backend.push_folder, backend.pop_folder

implemented git update (git pull)



[20120116]

pgu changed, so we have first svn changes
  - actually caused a conflict in gui5.py
    - had to interact by hand
      - need a default mode
  - svn still returns 0, even with the conflict
    - i think we will have to examine the entire output



[20120114]

got tracker working under python3

----

updated to support capturing stdout/stderr, and caller
has option to report or not.

main point is to suppress "no updates" noise.

applied to mercurial first

----

started hg management of project - based on hginit.com

hg init

----

baby steps toward:

- use tracker to check out from 
    tracker co https://github.com/drewbuschhorn/gmail_imap.git
  - must already be in the correct parent folder

tracker co https://github.com/drewbuschhorn/gmail_imap.git

a non-bug

(B) i did something wrong with src/games/mud/evennia, trying to track it
    - svn project
    - 
    - linked to tracking/games/mud/evennia -> evennia/svn
    - but that only has an evennia folder, which is *not* svn ???
      - by hand, have to "cd evennia; svn update"
      - i think it's an issue with not really finding the root vsc_folder correctly
    - still, shouldn't it dive in?

it actually works - dives as deep as it needs to

cd src/tracking/games/mud

tracker update evennia

baby steps toward checkout

cd src/games/pygame/libs

tracker checkout http://lwpgt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ lwpgt-read-only


  works

    actually, not quite - 

----

cd src/cloud

mkdir -p bixo
cd bixo

tracker checkout git://github.com/emi/bixo.git

  that didn't work quite right - checked out bixo

move that into git folder


TODO:
   - automatically track it

TODO:
    - specify dest/category - don't have to cd









[20091010]

modified tracker
   (and refactored to have Project, VCSBackend, ...)

tracker update

----

working out how we will check out code

case study:

  http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-kernel/trunk/

  note: no clues about type of repo
    choices: 
        - try flavors in order

by hand:

cd src 

mkdir -p ui/lively-kernel/svn
cd ui/lively-kernel/svn

svn co http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-kernel

cd ../..

tracker track lively-kernel

dusting off tracker system (again)

new challenge is the large number of new systems: svn, hg, bzr, git

trying to use pyvcs  http://github.com/alex/pyvcs/

cd packages/dev/vcs/pyvcs/git/pyvcs

  git clone git://github.com/alex/pyvcs.git

also says it needs pysvn

python setup.py install

  XXX no setuptools

just try using from where it is

PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/Users/jeff/packages/dev/vcs/pyvcs/git

  pretty crappy doc, no 

add a script pyvcs-co 

  actually, no: use oompa/scripts/checkout
     (moved from oompa/cvsu/scripts)

#
# in track-utils.sh
#
PATH=$PATH:/Users/jeff/sandbox/oompa/scripts

XXX there is nothing about checking out


which track

track 


cd ~/src/python/pypy

track pypy

  now there is a link from /users/jeff/src/tracking/python/pypy


TODO: change "track" to "tracker track",
so that we can use "tracker update" as cvsu-py

tracker track pypy



----

next challenge - 

cd src/web/google-wave/wave-protocol

did not check out into 

  just moving it, for now.  clever discovery later.

  it's really better to have explicit folder for hg, svn, ...
    - lets you also have versioned tarballs, ...


cd src/web/gogle-wave

tracker track wave-protocol
tracker track wave-robot-python-client-read-only

tracker update

XXX problem: in tracker tree, there is not an explicit "hg" folder
