You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you
want to merge with, and 'branch.deep-tracing.merge' in
your configuration file does not tell me, either. Please
specify which branch you want to use on the command line and
try again (e.g. 'git pull <repository> <refspec>').
See git-pull(1) for details.

If you often merge with the same branch, you may want to
use something like the following in your configuration file:
    [branch "deep-tracing"]
    remote = <nickname>
    merge = <remote-ref>

    [remote "<nickname>"]
    url = <url>
    fetch = <refspec>

See git-config(1) for details.

this one is probably trickier.  i *have* done a ton of work in a gensim 
checkout, but i thought it was separate


ah, right.  this was an experiment in trying to work on a branch
in the same repo that i'm updating.  i don't think it worked

just start over.  moved git to git-failed-attempted-deep-tracing-branch

added another git pattern: http://git.code.sf.net/p/guitarix/git

updated tests

cd sandbox/oompa

  failed.  not sure why, but not about this change

cd tracking/tests

nosetests

  yep, works

----

this checkout (with an alternate name) is throwing the checkout off:

instructions say "git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/guitarix/git guitarix"

tracker co http://git.code.sf.net/p/guitarix/git guitarix

  the project is checked out as "git", not "guitarix"

  write some tests in test_VCSBackend, and fix VCSBackend._determine_project_name

tracker co http://git.code.sf.net/p/guitarix/git guitarix

  figured out guitarix, but checked out in to git/git/guitarix

enough for today.  just check out and track the hard way this time




[20120219]

added another git pattern - git://

trying to find the problem with checkout - always crashes during the
track part, at least with git - a folder exists where we are trying to
make a symlink

trying to check out roundup, and i think sourceforge shut me down,
though something was wrong, because i'm trying a checkout multiple
times

hg output much better



[20120213]

cleaned up hg output a little bit

  - don't care about these:
    comparing with https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy
    searching for changes
    changeset:   52394:286b7a2ad62f
    parent:      52392:f312b056bb07


TODO: make this *optional* - maybe some people do care

-----

tabling this one.  it's nice to remember everything i want to track,
and it's not that much noise (yet)

- option to only report projects that have updates,
  vs reporting all that we are about to try ...
  - just wait to report "updating"
    - might be tricky, i think those messages are separate



[20120212]

stopped reporting the second half of the mercurial output - the part
that talks about "adding changeset", ...  the number of files changed
does not matter in this context.  just more noise


[20120204]

starting over with source.  too much cruft, some of it 10 years old
and no longer really useful

moved sandbox/oompa to sandbox/oompa-old, and only copied 
over enough to get tracker to run.

hg init

# add everything that's in there now
#   XXX how to automatically ignore __pycache__ and .pyc?

switching over to list-based pattern detection, using tests

added hack to dictate that bitbucket is hg.  XXX which is not always
correct - bitbucket supports both

tracker checkout http://openblox.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/openblox/openblox 





[20120118]

fixed backend.push_folder, backend.pop_folder

implemented git update (git pull)



[20120116]

pgu changed, so we have first svn changes
  - actually caused a conflict in gui5.py
    - had to interact by hand
      - need a default mode
  - svn still returns 0, even with the conflict
    - i think we will have to examine the entire output



[20120114]

got tracker working under python3

----

updated to support capturing stdout/stderr, and caller
has option to report or not.

main point is to suppress "no updates" noise.

applied to mercurial first

----

started hg management of project - based on hginit.com

hg init

baby steps toward:

- use tracker to check out from 
    tracker co https://github.com/drewbuschhorn/gmail_imap.git
  - must already be in the correct parent folder

a non-bug

(B) i did something wrong with src/games/mud/evennia, trying to track it
    - svn project
    - 
    - linked to tracking/games/mud/evennia -> evennia/svn
    - but that only has an evennia folder, which is *not* svn ???
      - by hand, have to "cd evennia; svn update"
      - i think it's an issue with not really finding the root vsc_folder correctly
    - still, shouldn't it dive in?

it actually works - dives as deep as it needs to

cd src/tracking/games/mud

tracker update evennia

cd src/cloud

working out how we will check out code

case study:

dusting off tracker system (again)

new challenge is the large number of new systems: svn, hg, bzr, git

trying to use pyvcs  http://github.com/alex/pyvcs/

cd packages/dev/vcs/pyvcs/git/pyvcs

  git clone git://github.com/alex/pyvcs.git

also says it needs pysvn

python setup.py install

  XXX no setuptools

just try using from where it is

PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/Users/jeff/packages/dev/vcs/pyvcs/git

  pretty crappy doc, no 

add a script pyvcs-co 

  actually, no: use oompa/scripts/checkout
     (moved from oompa/cvsu/scripts)

#
# in track-utils.sh
#
PATH=$PATH:/Users/jeff/sandbox/oompa/scripts

XXX there is nothing about checking out


which track

track 


cd ~/src/python/pypy

track pypy

  now there is a link from /users/jeff/src/tracking/python/pypy


TODO: change "track" to "tracker track",
so that we can use "tracker update" as cvsu-py

tracker track pypy



----

next challenge - 

cd src/web/google-wave/wave-protocol

did not check out into 

  just moving it, for now.  clever discovery later.

  it's really better to have explicit folder for hg, svn, ...
    - lets you also have versioned tarballs, ...


cd src/web/gogle-wave

tracker track wave-protocol
tracker track wave-robot-python-client-read-only

tracker update

XXX problem: in tracker tree, there is not an explicit "hg" folder
