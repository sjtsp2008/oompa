organization for tracking

src/github/{user,org}

  not distinguishing users and orgs here, since github urls don't

  (10 minutes later, i already changed my mind - easier for me if i know
   it's a user or org)

  src/github/user/...
  src/github/organization/...


note: doing things this way is going to put pressure on symlinks for
the "folksonomy" organization


baby step: "tracker discover"
  - list projects 
    - stash what i saw
  - list new projects
    - describe them
    

# github is implied, for now

tracker discover chriswhong




tracker discover amplab




TODO: generate simple bayes classifier, with project name/description, and maybe readme, as features

  - train with the projects that i have checked out
  
  - eventually: not just yes/no, but what tags would i apply?

install github3.py, with goal of tracking companies/developers (i
frequently want to see what else someone is working on, once i like
one of their projects)


sudo pip install github3.py

note: pulls in a nice-looking library called "requests":

Requests: HTTP for Humans

Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely
verbose and cumbersome. Python's builtin urllib2 module provides most
of the HTTP capabilities you should need, but the api is thoroughly
broken. It requires an enormous amount of work (even method overrides)
to perform the simplest of tasks.

Things shouldn't be this way. Not in Python.

>>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com', auth=('user', 'pass'))
>>> r.status_code
204
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'application/json'
>>> r.text
...


Requests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers,
form data, multipart files, and parameters with simple Python
dictionaries, and access the response data in the same way. It's
powered by httplib and urllib3, but it does all the hard work and
crazy hacks for you.

Features

    International Domains and URLs
    Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling
    Sessions with Cookie Persistence
    Browser-style SSL Verification
    Basic/Digest Authentication
    Elegant Key/Value Cookies
    Automatic Decompression
    Unicode Response Bodies
    Multipart File Uploads
    Connection Timeouts
    Thread-safety
    HTTP(S) proxy support


and anothe package:

uritemplate

Simple python library to deal with URI Templates. The API looks like

from uritemplate import URITemplate, expand

# NOTE: URI params must be strings not integers

gist_uri = 'https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists{/gist_id}'
t        = URITemplate(gist_uri)

print(t.expand(gist_id='123456'))

# => https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists/123456

# or
print(expand(gist_uri, gist_id='123456'))

# also
t.expand({'gist_id': '123456'})
print(expand(gist_uri, {'gist_id': '123456'}))


Where it might be useful to have a class

import requests

class GitHubUser(object):
    url = URITemplate('https://api.github.com/user{/login}')
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.api_url = url.expand(login=name)
        response = requests.get(self.api_url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            self.__dict__.update(response.json())

When the module containing this class is loaded, GitHubUser.url is
evaluated and so the template is created once. It's often hard to
notice in Python, but object creation can consume a great deal of time
and so can the re module which uritemplate relies on. Constructing the
object once should reduce the amount of time your code takes to run.

You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you
want to merge with, and 'branch.deep-tracing.merge' in
your configuration file does not tell me, either. Please
specify which branch you want to use on the command line and
try again (e.g. 'git pull <repository> <refspec>').
See git-pull(1) for details.

If you often merge with the same branch, you may want to
use something like the following in your configuration file:
    [branch "deep-tracing"]
    remote = <nickname>
    merge = <remote-ref>

    [remote "<nickname>"]
