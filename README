A small orange robot to help you keep up with rapidly changing
software, which also sometimes sings bad songs regarding your
character flaws.

it used to be quite ambitious - in the pre-source-control days, would
track and download source tar.gz on ftp sites, untar, and run a
project-specific set of steps (e.g., configure, make, ...)

right now (201202) it is back to simple tracking of changes from remote
svn, hg, git repositories
